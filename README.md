# Project 4 - West Nile Virus Prediction

## **Problem Statement**

At the Disease And Treatment Agency, we’re working with data from Chicago’s mosquito surveillance and control system to see if we can learn anything about the recent epidemic of the West Nile Virus (WNV) in the city.

We’re tasked to make predictions about the presence of WNV in various sections of the city so officials can decide if and where to spray pesticides.

## **Objective:**
1. Predict the presence of WNV based on data for a specific site at a specific time.
2. Conduct a cost-benefit analysis - when to spray the pesticides and where to spray the pesticides

## **Summary**

1. Achieved a score of 0.768 by blending several models together.
2. West Nile Virus has a significant economical impact (est. ~ $6.25 mil).
3. Aerial spray allows better spray coverage compared to ground-based spray in terms of cost.
4. Benefit of spraying are ambiguous due to improper testing procedure.
5. Crucial need for a stringent monitoring regime with regular interval testing - and null results (zero mosquitos) must be recorded.
